# Assumptions Registry

## Active Assumptions

Assumptions that are currently guiding decisions but have not been validated.

| ID | Assumption | Phase Introduced | Validation Method | Status |
|----|------------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| A1 | | | | open |

## Validated Assumptions

Assumptions that have been confirmed through research or experimentation.

| ID | Assumption | Validated In | Evidence | Validated At |
|----|------------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| V1 | | | | |

## Invalidated Assumptions

Assumptions that proved false, with impact assessment.

| ID | Assumption | Invalidated In | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------------|----------------|--------|------------|
| I1 | | | | |

## Validation Rules

1. **Every assumption must have an ID** in format `{Phase}{Number}` (e.g., B1 for Brainstorm assumption 1)
2. **Open assumptions must be validated or invalidated** before the Build phase
3. **New assumptions discovered mid-phase** must be added immediately
4. **Invalidated assumptions require impact assessment** and possible decision revision
