| ID | Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Owner | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|-------------|--------|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| R1 | | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | P×I | | | open |

## Mitigated Risks

## Risk Scoring

- **Probability:** High (≥70%), Medium (30-69%), Low (<30%)
- **Impact:** High (project failure), Medium (significant delay/cost), Low (minor inconvenience)
- **Score:** H=3, M=2, L=1; Score = P × I

## Risk Thresholds

| Score | Action Required |
|-------|-----------------|
| 9 (H×H) | Mandatory debate before proceeding |
| 6 (H×M or M×H) | Document mitigation plan |
| 4 (M×M) | Monitor closely |
| 3-2 (H×L, L×H, M×L, L×M) | Acknowledge and accept |
| 1 (L×L) | Track for awareness |

## Risk Triggers

Conditions that require updating this registry:
- New risk identified in any phase
- Existing risk materializes
- Mitigation plan fails
- Risk score changes
